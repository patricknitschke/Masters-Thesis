    abstract={In the heavy asset industry, such as oil {\&} gas, offshore personnel need to locate various equipment on the installation on a daily basis for inspection and maintenance purposes. However, locating equipment in such GPS denied environments is very time consuming due to the complexity of the environment and the large amount of equipment. To address this challenge we investigate an alternative approach to study the navigation problem based on visual imagery data instead of current ad-hoc methods where engineering drawings or large CAD models are used to find equipment. In particular, this paper investigates the combination of deep learning and decomposition for the image retrieval problem which is central for visual navigation. A convolutional neural network is first used to extract relevant features from the image database. The database is then decomposed into clusters of visually similar images, where several algorithms have been explored in order to make the clusters as independent as possible. The Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach is then applied on each cluster to build a vocabulary forest. During the searching process the vocabulary forest is exploited to find the most relevant images to the query image. To validate the usefulness of the proposed framework, intensive experiments have been carried out using both standard datasets and images from industrial environments. We show that the suggested approach outperforms the BoW-based image retrieval solutions, both in terms of computing time and accuracy. We also show the applicability of this approach on real industrial scenarios by applying the model on imagery data from offshore oil platforms.},

  abstract = {Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a unified, probabilistic approach. The coverage combines breadth and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as discussion of recent developments in the field, including conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning. The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing, computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled model-based approach, often using the language of graphical models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB software package----PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)---that is freely available online.},

  abstract = 	 {Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful technique to train an agent to perform a task; however, an agent that is trained using RL is only capable of achieving the single task that is specified via its reward function. Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a room or moving objects to varying locations. Instead, we propose a method that allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable of performing in its environment. We use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to try to accomplish, each task being specified as reaching a certain parametrized subset of the state-space. The generator network is optimized using adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level of difficulty for the agent, thus automatically producing a curriculum. We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically learn to perform a wide set of tasks without requiring any prior knowledge of its environment, even when only sparse rewards are available.

    abstract = {Classically, data interpolation with a parametrized model class is possible as long as the number of parameters is larger than the number of equations to be satisfied. A puzzling phenomenon in deep learning is that models are trained with many more parameters than what this classical theory would suggest. We propose a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. We prove that for a broad class of data distributions and model classes, overparametrization is necessary if one wants to interpolate the data smoothly. Namely we show that smooth interpolation requires d times more parameters than mere interpolation, where d is the ambient data dimension. We prove this universal law of robustness for any smoothly parametrized function class with polynomial size weights, and any covariate distribution verifying isoperimetry. In the case of two-layers neural networks and Gaussian covariates, this law was conjectured in prior work by Bubeck, Li and Nagaraj. We also give an interpretation of our result as an improved generalization bound for model classes consisting of smooth functions.},
