\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

Without help, writing a master's thesis with a scope as large as this would be impossible. Thus, I give credit where credit is due.
Firstly, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Kostas for his tips, insight and expertise during our meetings, which have laid the foundation for this thesis.
Secondly, I would like to thank my PhD. co-supervisors, Huan and Mihir, for their extensive help: Huan, for helping me with tools for learning PyTorch, designing the VAE, and providing tips on improving it; Mihir, for creating the base of the quadrotor task and feedback on how to design the agent experiment.
Both have also provided important feedback on the PPO reward, sported long after-hour meetings, and shared support.
Also, I thank the cybernetics department, particularly Gunnar Aske, for lending me a powerful PC to run Isaac Gym.

Then, I must show appreciation to my friends at \textit{sal} who have provided feedback, late-night company, and also moral support. Finally, I thank my family and partner, who have facilitated the last few weeks of this thesis.
