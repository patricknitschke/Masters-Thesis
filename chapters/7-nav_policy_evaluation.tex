For our thesis, training and simulation was done on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10940X CPU @ 3.30GHz desktop PC, with three NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs. 

\section{Policy Performance along the Learning Curriculum}
Put table here

\subsection{Without Obstacles}
\subsection{1 Obstacles}
\subsection{3 Obstacles}
\subsection{5 Obstacles}
\subsection{9 Obstacles}

\section{Evaluating the Learned Navigation Policy}

Test in 3 ``hard'' envs

For each
2-3 qualitative results (maps, path, actions vel ref)
statistical study with randomized  - numbers of times it crashes
