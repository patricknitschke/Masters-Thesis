\chapter*{Abstract}

A condensation of the essential information of the article.

autonomous navigation in cluttered envs is hard

model based pipeline is too slow

hello learning-based methods

two-part model -- perception and control

use a curriculum,
utilise a massive learning regime

obtain the results ....

we found that this works -- model-free RL is super nice -- plug and play with unsupervised representation to obtain robust collision avoidance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.
